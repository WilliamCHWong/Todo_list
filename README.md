# React Todo App

A simple Todo List application built with React. The app allows users to:
- Add new todos
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

This project is split into multiple components to make the code modular and reusable.
